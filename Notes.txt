		//4. tree view (I think this will be hard)
		
		//5. Enter a user panel
		//6. Implement the following through the UI
		//7. Tweet to your own page
		//8. Tweeting updates everyone you follow
		
		//singleton - admin?
		
		//observer - each user can follow the others
		
		//visitor - positive messages?
		
		//composite - groups and users, groups can contain groups and users
		
		//easy to keep count for new users/groups using the buttons
		//probably create an interface to create panels/buttons
		//use Swing menu? and add action listeners perhaps
		
		//user
			//leaf node of tree
			//follow
			//post
			
			
		//group
			//just contains list of groups/users
